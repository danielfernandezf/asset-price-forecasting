#  Asset Price Forecasting (Stocks, Crypto, Gold)
>  **[WORK IN PROGRESS]** This project is currently under development.

##  Project Overview
This repository contains time series forecasting models designed to predict the future prices of various financial assets, including stocks, cryptocurrencies, and commodities like gold. The project explores the challenges of financial market volatility and trend prediction.

##  Tech Stack (Planned)
* Python
* Pandas (Time Series manipulation)
* Statsmodels (ARIMA/SARIMA) / Prophet
* API integration (e.g., yfinance) for real-time data

##  To-Do List
- [x] Initial repository setup.
- [ ] Integrate financial APIs to fetch historical data.
- [ ] Perform time series decomposition (trend, seasonality, noise).
- [ ] Train statistical models (ARIMA) and/or Machine Learning models.
- [ ] Backtest predictions against historical data.
- [ ] Visualize forecasted prices vs. actual market movements.
